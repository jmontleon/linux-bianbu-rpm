Subject: [PATCH 0764/1206] riscv: show reason of unaligned access speed are
 different among cores

the debug info is:
cpu6: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 1.95, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu2: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 3.03, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu3: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 2.95, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu4: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 1.97, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu7: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 1.95, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu1: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 2.74, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu5: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 2.16, unaligned accesses are fast
cpu0: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 10.16, unaligned accesses are fast

cpu0 is more efficient than other cores because of system bandwith preemption.
